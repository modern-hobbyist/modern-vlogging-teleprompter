# modern-vlogging-teleprompter
A Mini version of the teleprompter I previously made, for handheld filming and vlogging

# PCB Files
The Gerber files for the Macro Keyboard can be found in this repository in a zip file. 
This should be all you need to order custom PCB's to recreate this project.

# Code
The code for this can be found in the following repositories. Setup for the
teleprompter server for this project is the same as the full size teleprompter
and the code for macro keyboard is also the same, though the PCB was redesigned to use JST connectors for more flexibility.
